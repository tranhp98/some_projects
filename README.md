# Overview
This repo contains 2 projects that might be of interest. The first project in the directory 'test_properties' is my research project where I run many Deep Learning 
tasks on common architectures such as Bert, GPT, Resnet,... and try to understand the optimization properties of each. The second project in the directory 'cv_task' is a small
computer vision project in my Machine Learning class where we were given a synthetic dataset and had to figure out a way to solve the given problem using the dataset.
